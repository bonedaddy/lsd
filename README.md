# LSD

LSD (LoRa ShutDown) is a killswitch-type device for shutting down machines out-of-band using LoRa as the transmission medium. It is a small form factor and thus easy to hide, and able to run off battery for long periods of time. It allows using either a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Dragino HAT, or an Arduino Uno and a Dragino Shield.

# Equipment Needed

* RPi 3
* Arduino Uno
* Dragino LoRa/GPS HAT v1.4
* Dragino LoRa Shield
